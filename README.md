## Versioning

Versions are computed by [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning)
from [`version.json`](version.json) plus the git height — there is no hardcoded version anywhere.
`version.json` holds the `major.minor`; the patch is the number of commits since that value last
changed, so **every commit bumps the patch automatically**.

Install the CLI once:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global nbgv
```

### Viewing the version

```powershell
nbgv get-version                    # full summary for HEAD
nbgv get-version -v SimpleVersion   # just x.y.z, for scripts
nbgv get-version -f json            # everything, as JSON
```

### Setting the version

The patch bumps on its own with every commit. To change the major or minor, hand-edit the
`version` field in `version.json` and commit it — the patch count restarts from there:

```json
"version": "1.3"
```

Do **not** run `nbgv set-version`. It rewrites `version.json` from scratch and silently drops the
`publicReleaseRefSpec` and `cloudBuild` settings this repo relies on. Never add a `<Version>`
element to `Directory.Build.props` or a `.csproj` either — it would override the computed version.

### Releases

A build from `release/production` is a public release and gets a clean version (`1.3.4`). Every
other branch is a prerelease and gets a commit-id suffix (`1.3.4-g1a2b3c4`). Pushing to
`release/production` triggers the [publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml).
